# 🧀🍷 Wine & Cheese Pairing

A beginner-friendly data project that pairs wines with cheeses using simple logic and datasets.

## 🔍 About the project

This project explores how to match wines with cheeses based on basic rules and simple data. It's a playful experiment to combine food and data – perfect for beginners learning Python and data analysis.

## 📁 Project structure



## 🧠 How the pairing works

- Each wine has certain characteristics (e.g., red/white, sweet/dry).
- Each cheese has a flavor profile (e.g., mild, strong, creamy).
- Simple logic is used to find possible matches based on compatibility.

## ✅ What you’ll learn

- How to work with CSV files in Python
- How to match two datasets with basic rules
- How to structure and share a small data project
