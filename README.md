# 🧀🍷 Wine & Cheese Pairing

A small data project for everyone who loves wine, cheese, and learning the basics of working with data.

## 🔍 What it's about

We wanted to try combining something tasty with something we're learning – and that’s how this wine & cheese pairing project was born.  
We work with two datasets (wines and cheeses) and try to find combinations that make sense based on simple logic.

## 📁 Project structure



## 🧠 How it works

- Each wine has basic characteristics (e.g. color, sweetness).
- Each cheese has a flavor profile (e.g. mild, strong, creamy).
- We use simple rules to find which ones go well together.

## ✅ What we practiced

- Reading and working with CSV files in Python  
- Writing basic logic to match two datasets  
- Structuring and sharing a small data project on GitHub


## ✨ Example result

| Wine            | Suggested Cheese     |

| Merlot          | Gouda                |
| Chardonnay      | Brie                 |
| Sauvignon Blanc | Goat Cheese          |

> **Note:** This project was created as part of our learning journey in data analysis. It's intentionally simple – the goal was to practice basic concepts and try something fun.
